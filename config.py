Rules of the game. The game is quite popular in Russia and the former CIS countries. To play, you need a deck of 36 cards and 2 to 4 players. The first dealer in the game is determined by lot, in subsequent games the players deal cards in turn. The deck is carefully shuffled, removed, and each player is dealt 5 cards. The dealer gives himself 4 cards, and the fifth card is put on the horse. The remaining deck is placed face down in the center of the table. The player to the left of the dealer continues the game. He must put a card of the same suit or a card of the same value on the dealer's fifth card, if there is no such card, then the player takes one card from the deck, and if this card does not match, then the player skips the turn. Some cards have their own characteristics in the game, namely: Aces, Queens, King of Spades, Nines, Sevens and Sixes.

An ace must be placed only in a suit or another ace. The ace prohibits the run to the next player. During a two-player game, the turn remains with the player. If there are three or four players, then the turn goes through one player.
Queens can lie on any card and any suit. The player who placed the queen orders a favorable suit and the turn passes to the next player. If the player ends the game on any queen, then 20 points are deducted from him, if the player ends the game on the queen of spades, then 40 points are deducted from him.
A king of spades can only be placed on a king of any suit and on any spade card. The next player who moves takes 4 cards from the deck and passes the turn.
If a player lays a nine, he must cover it with the same suit or nine. The nine must be closed again with the same suit. If the player does not have such cards, then the player takes cards from the deck until he closes the nine.
A seven can be placed only on a seven or in a suit, the next player takes two cards from the deck and skips the turn.
A six can be placed only on a six or in a suit, the next player takes one card from the deck and skips the move.

If a player has 0 points and ends on a checker, he is credited minus 20 points. The game continues until one player has no cards left, or until one player has more than 101 points. The player who scores more than 101 points is considered to have lost. If any player scores 101 points, their score will be reset to zero.'''
